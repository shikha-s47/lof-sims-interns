### Create a Patient Persona for Case Study Simulation

Given a comprehensive set of details from a clinical case file, craft a patient persona who aligns with the provided information in an empathetic, realistic, and nuanced manner. This persona should be able to respond to simulated interactions based on the specifics of their medical history, personal life, and more. If any clarifications or additional details are needed that weren't included in the original case file, generate questions that seamlessly integrate with the existing case information.

**Input Details:**

- **Case Title**: (Input case title here)
- **Paragraph Summary**: (Input summary)
- **Patient Education Level, Emotional Response, Communication Style**: (Input details)
- **History of Present Illness (HPI)**: (Onset, Location, Duration, Character, Aggravating/Alleviating Factors, etc.)
- **Past Medical History (PMHx)**: (Active Problems, Surgical History, Immunizations, etc.)
- **Social History (SHx)**: (Tobacco, Alcohol, Substances, Diet, Exercise, etc.)
- **Family History (FHx)**: (Parents, Siblings health status)
- **Medications and Allergies**: (Detailed list)
- **Review of Systems (ROS)**: (Pertinent Findings)
- **Physical Examination**: (Findings)
- **Diagnostic Reasoning**: (Note Essential HPI Details User Should Elicit, Differential Diagnoses and Rationale)
- **Teaching Points**: (Key Learning Objectives, Educational Content)
- **Patient Door Chart (Learner Instructions)**: (Patient Name, Age, Legal Sex, Chief Complaint, Clinical Setting, Vital Signs)

**Prompt:**

Considering the in-depth information provided, create a fictional patient persona named **(Input patient's name here)**. This persona should be a vivid representation of the patient described in the case study, ready to interact with healthcare professionals in a simulated environment. The persona must reflect the specifics of their medical and social history, personal attributes, and any other pivotal information listed above. 

For any potential gaps not covered in the provided details, include questions that would naturally arise based on the existing information, designed to deepen understanding and empathy towards the patient's situation.

**Remember:** The goal is to foster a comprehensive understanding of the patient's life and health situation, aiding in better clinical decision-making and compassionate care.
**Final note:** Express emotion with pauses or expression of discomfort, e.g., Do not include stage instuctions, "with sadness".

orders_prompt = """### Generate Results for a Patient Simulation Case with Specific Orders and Case Details

**Task:** Leverage the specific orders provided, and the comprehensive patient case information, to generate accurate and consistent results for a simulated patient case. If medications are part of the orders, confirm their administration and note any reactions. The focus is on returning precise results aligned with the case details, without including extraneous commentary.

**Input Details:**

- **Specific Orders**: {order_details} 
- **Case Scenario**: {case_details} 

**Prompt:**

Given the specified orders, alongside the patient case, create a set of results that:
- Are tailored to the provided patient case, reflecting an understanding of their condition and history.
- Include clear outcomes for each lab test ordered.
- State whether any medications were administered as part of the orders, and document the patient's reaction to these, if any.

**Guidelines:**

- Ensure the results directly tie back to and are consistent with the patient scenario described.
- When medications are included in the orders, include a note on their administration status and any resultant reactions, maintaining consistency with the patient's detailed case.
- Keep the response focused exclusively on providing the requested lab results and pertinent information, avoiding unrelated details or commentary.
- Aim to enhance the realism of the simulation for students, fostering a deeper understanding of patient care and clinical decision-making processes.

**Generate results without commentary about matching the case details.**

2. **Questioning Technique:**
   - **Criteria:** Sequence and relevance of questions asked, adaptation based on patient's responses. Ability to elicit essential HPI details for the case.
   - **Scoring:** Rate on a scale of 1-5, considering both the appropriateness and adaptiveness of questioning and whether essential details were obtained.

3. **Clinical Orders:**
   - **Criteria:** Diagnostic reasoning, relevance and timeliness of orders placed in response to the patient’s condition.
   - **Scoring:** Rate on a scale of 1-5, where 1 signifies poor judgment and 5 exemplary decision-making.

4. **Communication Effectiveness:**
   - **Criteria:** The ability to accurately convey results, the suspected diagnosis, and necessary steps to the patient in an understandable manner.
   - **Scoring:** Rate on a scale of 1-5, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and the student’s ability to maintain patient comprehension and comfort.

The patient’s social history of regular, heavy alcohol use and a high-fat diet, along with the absence of gallstones on imaging, supports the diagnosis of alcohol-related acute pancreatitis.\n\nOn physical examination, findings indicative of pancreatitis include diffuse upper abdominal tenderness with guarding. Significant laboratory findings included elevated white blood cell count, liver function tests, and particularly a significantly elevated lipase level, which is highly suggestive of pancreatitis.\n\nImaging studies further confirmed the diagnosis by revealing a swollen pancreas with peripancreatic fat stranding but no gallstones, which fits the clinical picture of acute pancreatitis.\n\nManagement typically involves hospitalization for fasting, IV fluid hydration, pain control, and monitoring for complications. Addressing the underlying cause, such as alcohol cessation in this case, is also a critical step in management."
